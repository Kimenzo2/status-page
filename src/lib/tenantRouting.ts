/**
 * Shared (client + server) tenant-path routing helpers.

 *   status.productclient.com/faith/uptime    -> tenant uptime view
 *
 * Routing follows the same shape as Mintlify's subpath hosting: the tenant
 * segment is stripped before route matching (see src/hooks.ts reroute), while
 * src/hooks.server.ts resolves the tenant record from the original URL. The
 * two must agree on which first segments belong to the app itself, so the
 * reserved list lives here where both sides can import it.
